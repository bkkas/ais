# AIS - An open source AIS data analyzer

AIS (automatic identification system) is a tracking system for maritime vessels.

This project's aim is to provide useful tools to analyze, aggregate and extract information from historical AIS datasets.

AIS equipment provides information such as unique identification, position, course, and speed to other vessels and central authorities
Live AIS data can be viewed online through a variety of web services.  

Historical AIS data can be freely accessed online, e.g. via the
Norwegian Coastal Administration (https://ais-public.kystverket.no/) or the Danish Maritime Authority (http://web.ais.dk/aisdata/).
